# ServiceNow User Administration Project

## âœ… Overview
This is a hands-on project where I configured User Administration in ServiceNow, focusing on creating a support group from scratch, assigning roles, adding group members, and setting up managerial relationships.

## âœ… Key Achievements
- Created a group named **Strawberry Support** under **Service Desk**.
- Assigned **Fred Luddy** as Group Manager.
- Added the **itil role** for IT Service Management.
- Added 5 group members:
  - Beth Anglin
  - Bud Richman
  - David Loo

  - Waldo Edberg
- Set Fred Luddy as Kara Prince's manager.
